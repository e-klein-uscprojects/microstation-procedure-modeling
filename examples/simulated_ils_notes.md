## Simulated ILS Component Modeling Notes

This file outlines a simulated approach to modeling ILS procedures using MicroStation. The exercise draws from professional logic applied during terminal alignment workflows.

### Components Modeled:
- **Localizer**: Placed along extended runway centerline
- **Glideslope**: Positioned at standardized intercept angles (typically 3.0°)
- **Outer Marker**: Located ~4–7 NM from touchdown
- **Middle Marker**: Positioned ~0.5–0.8 NM from runway threshold
- **Compass Locator**: Used to align precision approach navigation

Each component was aligned using vector tools, rotational controls, and lateral measurement overlays to ensure procedural accuracy within fictional airspace boundaries.
