## Simulated SID Structure

This example outlines a structured SID (Standard Instrument Departure) modeled using MicroStation’s vector editing tools and measurement systems.

### Departure Logic
- Runway: 09R (simulated)
- Initial Climb: Straight out to 500 feet AGL
- First Turn: Right turn to intercept FIX-DME radial
- Transition: Join J-route to waypoint chain (WPT01 → WPT03)

### Component Highlights
- Waypoints placed with lateral offsets using rotational mirror commands
- Altitude constraints reflected in graphical segment separation
- SID structure validated against simulated obstacle data overlays

This file illustrates the fundamental elements used in departure procedure modeling within representative environments.
