## Navaid Code Reference Guide

This reference list includes standard identifiers used during simulated IFR component modeling.

| Navaid Type     | Code | Description                     |
|------------------|------|---------------------------------|
| VOR              | B    | VHF Omnidirectional Range       |
| VORTAC           | D    | VOR + TACAN                     |
| TACAN            | G    | Tactical Air Navigation         |
| VOR/DME          | I    | VOR with Distance Measuring     |
| NDB              | L    | Non-Directional Beacon          |
| NDB/DME          | M    | NDB with Distance Measuring     |
| DME (non-ILS)    | O    | Standalone Distance Measuring   |

These codes supported modeling logic during the simulation of navigational overlays across SID, STAR, and ILS procedures.
