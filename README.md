# MicroStation Procedure Modeling

I am a graduate of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering with experience in aviation analytics, procedural modeling, and terminal design strategy. This repository reflects simulated workflows derived from professional aerospace operations, including the use of MicroStation for IFR modeling, navaid alignment, and glideslope configuration.

## Project Overview

The contents of this project document representative aviation design logic as applied in MicroStation, including geospatial placement strategies and navigational component validation across fictional flight environments.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Workflow summary  
- `tools/`: MicroStation hotkey reference  
- `references/`: Navaid code directory  
- `examples/`: Modeled notes and component guides  
- `visuals/`: Supporting diagrams (optional)

## Objective

To present a clear and methodical demonstration of tool fluency and procedural modeling logic used within regulated aviation data environments.
