## Workflow Summary

I am a graduate of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering with experience in aviation analytics, procedural modeling, and terminal design strategy. During my time supporting aerospace operations, I worked extensively with MicroStation to assist in the construction of IFR procedures, including glideslope modeling, navaid alignment, and the placement of precision components within simulated airspace environments.

In conducting this work, I relied not only on technical command of the software, but on the measured judgment required to replicate navigational logic within complex spatial frameworks. The approach detailed below reflects a generalized outline of that methodology, adapted for representative use:

1. Define runway geometry and initialize terminal data layers  
2. Assign vector segments for departure and arrival routing, including lateral offsets  
3. Position navaid components such as VOR, NDB, and DME with regulated spacing  
4. Align localizer path along extended centerline with rotational and mirroring commands  
5. Construct glideslope angles using vertical intercept parameters  
6. Apply measurement tools and directional trimming to validate overlay integrity  

Although this process has been presented using illustrative data and publicly available design logic, the structure itself closely follows established procedures within regulated flight modeling environments. It represents both a technical exercise and a reflection of the standards upheld during my professional work in aviation analytics.
