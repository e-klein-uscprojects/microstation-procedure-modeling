## MicroStation Hotkeys Reference

During my work supporting flight procedure digitization, these MicroStation commands were consistently used to streamline layout construction and ensure positional accuracy within navigational overlays.

### Manipulation Tools
- `3 1`: Copy elements
- `3 4`: Rotate vector segments
- `3 5`: Mirror placement objects
- `3 7`: Align elements by edge
- `7 5`: Trim to element

### Measurement & Drawing
- `9 1`: Measure Distance
- `Q 2`: Draw Line
- `W 2`: Draw Shape

### View & Navigation
- `F12`: Activate Drawing Tasks (if hotkeys fail)
- `4 5`: Fit View

### Group & Modification
- `CTRL + G`: Group selected elements
- `CTRL + Z`: Undo
- `CTRL + R`: Redo

These hotkeys formed the backbone of my procedure modeling routines, allowing precision placement of ILS components and terminal vectors during compliance-focused aviation modeling.
